\title{Semantic Analysis of Epilepsy-Related Patient Discharge Summaries}

\section{Background}
As defined by the NIH, Epilepsy is a brain disorder manifested in repeated seizures
over time.~\cite{nih-epilepsy}

\section{Approach}
The ultimate goal of the project is to produce a search-based web application.
Users will pose queries against an index of Patient Discharge Summaries, and the
application will output a subset of summaries deemed relevant based on a semantic
analysis of the data.

\subsection{Raw Data and OCR}
When an epileptic patient is discharged from care, a Patient Discharge Summary is
filled out, detailing the patient's history, symptoms, the tests administered, as
well as diagnoses and recommended treatement. The majority of the documents are
presented in natural English language, while certain standard portions are in a
more structured format, with well-defined attributes and values. Finally, some
reports include a graphical representation of EEG data, which will not be indexed.
The body of data is provided as PDF scans, without text data. This necessitates the use
of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to decipher the text from the PDF images.

\subsection{Parsing and Entity Recognition}
Once the text data is acquired, we will use the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK)
for the Python language to analyze the text syntactically to provide a structured
representation of the data. Once parsed, the tokens will be analyzed using specific
medical knowledge to determine the relevant entities found in the documents, and the
attribute values associated with them. Furthermore, the form portions of the documents
will be analyzed separately, since they are too structured to qualify as "natural
language."

\subsection{Indexing}
Each Discharge Summary will be associated with attributes and values based on the
entities recognized within the text. There will be a standard set of attributes
deemed important to all epilepsy-related Discharge Summaries. The standard set will
be determined partially from the medical knowledge base, and partially through an
analysis of the Discharge Summaries themselves for commonly reported information.
Every document entry will include these ancillary attributes, along with other
relevant information the document will contain. The documents will then be indexed
based on these attribute-value pairs. This indexing will take place in the background
dynamically as more Discharge Summaries are submitted to the knowledge base, and
the index along with the set of standard attributes will be updated dynamically.

\subsection{Search Application}
The website will present the user with search criteria by which he/she may find
the desired discharge summaries. These search criteria will be informed by the 
previously mentioned standard set of attributes. Numeric attributes such as dates
may be expressed as ranges. There will also be a search criterion for miscellaneous
information, which will utilize a thesaurus to find indexed attributes that do not
fall under the set of ancillary information. The user will then submit the search
query and retrieve a list of Discharge Summaries.
